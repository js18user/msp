Statement of the problem (Technical specifications for programming) It is necessary to develop a mailing management service. Design and develop a service that, according to given rules, launches a mailing list to a list of clients.

The "mailing" entity has the following attributes:

unique mailing id
mailing launch date and time
message text to be delivered to the client
filter properties of clients to whom the mailing should be carried out (mobile operator code, tag)
mailing end date and time: if for some reason all messages were not sent out, no messages should be delivered to clients after this time
The client entity has the following attributes:

unique client id
client phone number in the format 7XXXXXXXXXX (X is a number from 0 to 9)
mobile operator code
tag (arbitrary label)
Timezone
The message entity has the following attributes:

unique message id
date and time of creation (sending)
dispatch status
id of the mailing list within which the message was sent
id of the client to whom it was sent
Design and implement an API for:

adding a new client to the directory with all its attributes
client attribute data updates
removing a client from the directory
adding a new newsletter with all its attributes
obtaining general statistics on created mailings and the number of messages sent on them, grouped by status
obtaining detailed statistics of sent messages for a specific mailing list
mailing attribute updates
deleting the mailing list
processing active mailings and sending messages to clients
Mailing logic:

After creating a new mailing, if the current time is greater than the start time and less than the end time, all clients that match the filter values specified in this mailing must be selected from the directory and sending to all these clients must be started.

If a mailing is created with a start time in the future, the sending should start automatically when this time arrives without additional actions on the part of the system user.

As messages are sent, statistics should be collected (see the description of the “message” entity above) for each message for subsequent generation of reports.

An external service that receives sent messages may take a long time to process the request, respond with incorrect data, or not accept requests at all for some time. It is necessary to implement correct handling of such errors. Problems with the external service should not affect the stability of the developed mailing service.
